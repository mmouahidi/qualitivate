# Design System Audit & Implementation Plan

## 1. Design System Health Not
*   **Typography**: "Plus Jakarta Sans" is correctly set as the primary font in `index.css`. However, manual overrides (e.g., `font-weight` on headers) are diluting the system.
*   **Colors**: The palette (Indigo/Teal/Coral) is visually consistent but implementation is mixed between Tailwind utility classes (good) and occasional hardcoded values.
*   **Spacing**: Grid layouts generally respect the 4/8px grid, but vertical spacing between sections varies inconsistent.
*   **Shadows/Radius**: "Soft UI" aesthetics (custom shadows, `10px` radius) are present but applied via utility classes instead of reusable components.

## 2. Critical Consistency Issues (To Fix)
### A. Icon Anarchy
*   **Issue**: The app uses a mix of `lucide-react` (Landing Page) and hardcoded inline SVGs (Dashboard, Sidebar). This bloats the bundle and causes visual inconsistencies (stroke width, corner rounding).
*   **Location**: `Dashboard.tsx` defines local components (`SurveyIcon`, `ChartIcon`, etc.) at the bottom of the file instead of importing them. `Sidebar.tsx` has logic for switching images but also uses hardcoded icons.
*   **Fix**: Replace all inline SVGs with `lucide-react` imports.

### B. Component Primitives Missing
*   **Issue**: There are no `<Button>`, `<Input>`, or `<Card>` components. Styles are applied via long Tailwind class strings or `@apply` rules in `index.css` (e.g., `.btn-primary`, `.card-soft`).
*   **Impact**: Makes global updates difficult and accessibility attributes (aria-labels, focus states) are often missed.
*   **Fix**: Create `src/components/ui/` directory and implement base components.

### C. Loading States
*   **Issue**: `Dashboard.tsx` uses simple text "Loading..." which creates layout shifts when data loads.
*   **Fix**: Implement Skeleton loaders that mimic the final content shape.

## 3. Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Phase 1: Standardization (Immediate)**
    - [ ] Refactor `Dashboard.tsx`: Remove local SVG components -> Import `lucide-react`.
    - [ ] Refactor `Sidebar.tsx`: Ensure icon consistency.
    - [ ] Remove manual typography overrides in `index.css` or pages.

- [ ] **Phase 2: UI Library**
    - [ ] Create `components/ui/Button.tsx`.
    - [ ] Create `components/ui/Card.tsx`.
    - [ ] Create `components/ui/Badge.tsx`.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Visual Polish**
    - [ ] Replace text loading states with Shimmer/Skeleton components.
    - [ ] Audit contrast ratios on all secondary text (ensure `text-gray-500` is readable).

## 4. Brand & Assets
*   **Logo**: Recently updated to separate `logo.png` (full) and `icon.png` (mark). Behavior in Sidebar is correct but needs visual verification of alignment.
*   **Illustrations**: Inconsistent usage. Need to standardize on a set style (either 3D or Flat).
